Full stop.</p><p name="c8ff" id="c8ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why is listening so hard then?</p><p name="9f8e" id="9f8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not sure. Maybe the company doesn’t incentivize listening. Maybe listening and talking to customers would imply a lack of expertise. Maybe listening appears to slow releases.</p><p name="871a" id="871a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I champion listening at every job. Though, I’ve struggled to articulate why it’s important. Why should we talk to customers? Why test ideas <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">before</em> we launch? It’s the right thing to do, sure. It’ll make us more successful in the long run, totally. Data shows companies who test are more successful. The numbers are very clear.</p><p name="2c91" id="2c91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Design is listening. And design is for other people.</p><p name="1cf1" id="1cf1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It took about 4 months, but I got to sink my teeth into a greenfield marquee feature. We launched the feature very quickly, very little delay with design and engineering. Launching quickly gave customer feedback a more immediate feel. And I learned what happens when listening and talking to customers gets cut.</p><h3 name="a1b8" id="a1b8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Shift In Healthcare</h3><p name="2942" id="2942" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The healthcare industry is starting to adopt information technology into everyday operations. My company’s product helps clinics operate more efficiently in cost &amp; effort. Our product was evolving to add a new feature: tickets. A ticketing system isn’t a new idea in the world of software (see JIRA). However, most clinics don’t have a ticketing system bringing together all the different types of tickets into one digital system.</p><p name="65ff" id="65ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The ticketing feature worked like this:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="f73b" id="f73b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Patient issues would come into the clinic from several sources, such as phone calls, mobile app forms, and surveys</li><li name="8263" id="8263" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">All issues would be sorted by priority on a dashboard under each patient (a single patient could have multiple issues)</li><li name="a346" id="a346" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Nurses would take our product’s prioritization of patient issues and determine which patient they wanted to treat</li></ul><p name="2f1a" id="2f1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Our ticket board is similar to a to-do list, a to-do list of patients.</p><figure name="0b37" id="0b37" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 600px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 85.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*tX7DebksfWpNchfJ1f6MSA.png" data-width="1880" data-height="1612" data-focus-x="0" data-focus-y="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tX7DebksfWpNchfJ1f6MSA.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">An Example of the Ticket Board with fake data</figcaption></figure><p name="d9ca" id="d9ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Nurses worked on the board until it was clear. Having all the issues in one place made it easier to see how much work was to be done before the end of the workday. Same day responses were important to helping improve the quality of care.</p><p name="c4b8" id="c4b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The genesis of this feature came from the initial customer interviews when the company was started. Early listening kept this feature on the road map for a long time. Early listening gave this feature good bones.</p><h3 name="a5e7" id="a5e7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Details. Details. Details.</h3><p name="9989" id="9989" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The bones were good, the details, not so much. And the timeline of launch pushed us to convert a single source dashboard to a multiple source dashboard — not a strong foundation but a realistic one.</p><figure name="4d00" id="4d00" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 413px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 59%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*_w0EEPHNyAAE18jbPxGvjg.png" data-width="1239" data-height="731" data-focus-x="0" data-focus-y="0" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_w0EEPHNyAAE18jbPxGvjg.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">This dashboard only received updates from the mobile app. We would modify it to take 2 more sources.</figcaption></figure><p name="80f8" id="80f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The interplay between the list of tickets and a single ticket would make or break the feature. This feature needed to feel like it was made for the customer. Otherwise, our flow could easily be copied by a competitor. Giving the customer something that felt tailor-made is a great foundation for loyalty.</p><p name="5502" id="5502" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The old customer interviews held nothing helpful about this interaction. The tight timeline made talking to customers difficult. It got cut from the schedule.</p><p name="36f0" id="36f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, to meet my deadline, I made something up. I thought of how I would approach the workflow and went with it. I would not delay shipping.</p><p name="d13a" id="d13a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I called my solution the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Fullscreen Workflow</strong>. From a list of patients, selecting a ticket triggered a side panel with patient information. The panel tried to simulate “just what’s needed” for working with patient. A few actions and other metadata existed in the panel. The <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Manage Ticket </strong>button sent the nurse into the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Fullscreen Workflow </strong>to resolve the ticket.</p><p name="9475" id="9475" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I assumed the nurse didn’t need a bunch of extra information and context. Working on a patient ticket seemed like a focused activity. When I’m writing or doing something similarly focused, I fullscreen my application to do just that one thing.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow" data-paragraph-count="3"><figure name="9f4c" id="9f4c" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p" style="width: 31.971%;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 85.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*tX7DebksfWpNchfJ1f6MSA.png" data-width="1880" data-height="1612" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*tX7DebksfWpNchfJ1f6MSA.png"></div></figure><figure name="57f6" id="57f6" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure" style="width: 31.971%;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 85.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*KM4ZI1vk5AIvLWcSR_3Qmw.png" data-width="1880" data-height="1612" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*KM4ZI1vk5AIvLWcSR_3Qmw.png"></div></figure><figure name="22a3" id="22a3" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure" style="width: 36.057%;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 76.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*mhC5gs7M1TXoykjR8jQSJw.png" data-width="1880" data-height="1430" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*mhC5gs7M1TXoykjR8jQSJw.png"></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="f993" id="f993" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The design worked fine. I think the solution makes sense, judged on its own merit. No nurses are on the product team. We’ve since hired an on-staff nurse but after the fact. The solution got the green light.</p><h3 name="220c" id="220c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Real Talk</h3><p name="61a9" id="61a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">After release, we heard “I don’t have enough information” a lot. This was the main feedback customers relayed using the feature 8 hours a day. The feature was 70% right. That’s the good part! But, we flubbed the interplay the list of tickets and a single ticket by removing too much information. The nurses wanted the full breadth of patient information and medical history. By removing the history and information, we made it hard for nurses to weigh the context of current ticket issues with historical issues.</p><h3 name="4e34" id="4e34" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Lesson Learned</h3><p name="5b10" id="5b10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In considering what made sense to me, I failed to understand what made sense to nurses. I’m not a nurse. I’ve never gone to medical school. Nurses need to see different things than I need to see. This is the epitome of designing for other people. I am not them. Listening to them is how I understand their needs.</p><p name="aad8" id="aad8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Design really is listening.</p><p name="f8b9" id="f8b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Internalizing the importance of listening is one thing. But, what about when factors outside my control prevent it? The consequences of not listening are where I can make my case to the company and my teammates. I’d ask, “if we don’t have time to listen or talk to customers, do we have time to fix this if we get this wrong?”</p></div></div></section>
