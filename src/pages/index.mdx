# Hey, I'm glad you're here.

My name is **Brett Flora**. I'm a software engineer based in the United
States. Earlier in my career, I was a User Experience Designer. I bring a designer's eye
and compassionate heart to my engineering work. I enjoy building things for people,
especially tools. This [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)
is my hodgepodge of projects, essays, experiments, one-offs, and other non sequiturs.
