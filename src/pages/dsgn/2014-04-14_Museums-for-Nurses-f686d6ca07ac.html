Microsoft’s <a href="http://twitter.com/workjon" data-href="http://twitter.com/workjon" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Jon Bell&#39;s Twitter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jon Bell</a> was the brain behind the event. A small group of about 16 learned the ins and outs of what a user experience designer does and how to do it.</p><p name="ab24" id="ab24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All attendees were given a random product with a random demographic. The exercise was meant to show that user experience can be meaningfully applied even the most unlikely, this-will-never-get-made scenarios.</p><p name="208e" id="208e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was charged with creating a museum for nurses.</p><p name="a024" id="a024" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My gut reaction was it was an oddly specific demographic for a museum. Museums can only survive by targeting everyone (and probably government grant money). Now, that’s not to say museums can’t have a specific theme, but they certainly shouldn’t target a specific sub-group. They’d be shutdown pretty quick. And as far as nurses are concerned, I don’t think there are enough nurses in a given city to keep a museum’s lights on. Plus, nurses often work migrating shifts with long hours. What museum can accommodate such a wide variance? (Not including museums where the artifacts come to life at night. I’m looking at you, Ben Stiller).</p><h4 name="fa18" id="fa18" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Insights on museums</strong></h4><ul class="postList"><li name="97be" id="97be" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">often boring, dusty, and quiet like a library</li><li name="76b9" id="76b9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">please don’t touch, just look/read</li><li name="7568" id="7568" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">easy field trip for kids in school</li><li name="7582" id="7582" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">easy activity for parents with kids</li><li name="b4fe" id="b4fe" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">static exhibits that are always there</li><li name="2702" id="2702" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">return value found in rotating exhibits</li><li name="40d8" id="40d8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">often a 3D representation of what can be found in a history book</li><li name="84b8" id="84b8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">occupies a physical space</li><li name="63cc" id="63cc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">museums with interactivity have higher return value</li><li name="894d" id="894d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">museums with interactivity provide unique learning experience unable to be achieved in a history book or text book</li></ul><h4 name="7d00" id="7d00" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Insights on nurses</strong></h4><ul class="postList"><li name="8348" id="8348" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">are the “grunts” of the healthcare industry, they run the day-to-day of the hospital</li><li name="d921" id="d921" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">often seen as lower in hospital hierarchy (doctors up top)</li><li name="d87c" id="d87c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">work long hours, with inconsistent shifts</li><li name="a786" id="a786" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">are often women</li><li name="e022" id="e022" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">administer most treatments except the most complex</li><li name="8997" id="8997" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">high stress job</li></ul><h4 name="41b6" id="41b6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Overall Insights</strong></h4><p name="d42d" id="d42d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Making a museum aimed at bringing in nurses doesn’t seem feasible or smart. The demographic is too small and too specific. Museum’s with specific themes (like the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem) can draw international audiences because the content of the museum is specific. These museums still target the general population. I think the museum should be about nursing. The best museums have interactivity per their exhibits. Science museums have a great stream of revenue from attendance because their exhibits teach through experience, not lecture. Exhibits like pipes that are hot and cold teach kids (and adults) the reality of temperature and our body’s reactions to it. Touching pipes of differing temperatures can’t be <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">felt </em>in a book.</p><p name="3ef3" id="3ef3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A museum on nursing could take audiences through the history of nursing from it’s inception to today. Physical nursing “rooms” could be built in each time period. Objects used by nurses in that time period would be placed in each room. To heighten interactivity, audiences could watch or, even better, participate in a simulation of a procedure from that era of medicine. Something as simple as drawing blood or caring for a patient in a coma.</p><p name="0a04" id="0a04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An interactive approach like this would need more staff present than simply security. It would need innovative ways for the average person to realistically practice drawing blood without actually drawing blood from people. But, hey, we have the entire internet in our pockets…</p><p name="f910" id="f910" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nursing might be too small of a vision. An interactive museum on the evolution of medicine could encapsulate the whole of the hospital experience, from doctors to nurses and everyone in between. The same model could be used: faux hospitals from early eras of medicine that transition to the next era in subsequent rooms.</p><p name="193b" id="193b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The museum could even have two separate “tracks” based on doctors and nurses, depending on what an attendee is interested in. The tracks could be moving along in parallel, but, say for example the nursing track, would focus specifically on nurses in that era and what they did. This approach has the benefit of breaking the mountain of complex information that is medicine into small compartments for ease of understanding by the average person.</p><p name="31ce" id="31ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This idea of a physical walk through medicine’s history (with corresponding procedures) could be it’s own exhibit or wing in an existing museum like the American Red Cross Museum in Washington D.C.</p><h4 name="c0b5" id="c0b5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Goals</strong></h4><p name="1e29" id="1e29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The goal of any museum is to engage an audience in learning and understanding history, information, and processes. A history of medicine museum is no different.</p><p name="8cd8" id="8cd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The hardest goal with this subject matter is accessibility. An interactive museum with procedure simulation would be more accessible to adults than school children on a field trip. The exhibits would have to be simplified enough for kids to understand but without oversimplifying the information to where it’s complexity is lost. The other option is to have a special “kid-friendly” curriculum for when school kids are moving through the exhibit. This approach would need the structure of the exhibit to be more of a guided tour than a wander around on your own.</p><h4 name="7b93" id="7b93" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Tradeoffs</strong></h4><p name="07b3" id="07b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In achieving broad accessibility, complexity of information will be lost. If guided tours are a solution to the complexity problem, walk-in attendees or those without an appointment will not be able to experience the museum. However, quite a few museums and historic sites employ appointment only tours (like in Europe). These appointment only tours, while less convenient, don’t seem to discourage visitors. Plus, the added benefit of efficiency with touring can lead to more tours in a day than if visitors simply wandered on their own.</p><p name="bef7" id="bef7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another tradeoff would be repeat visiting. Once an exhibit of this complexity is established, new elements or complete changes of the program will be difficult and expensive. So, if a family from New Jersey visits the Medicine History exhibit, they may not go back for a few years to revisit, if ever. This is a general problem with all museums and static sites. However, looking again to Europe, I’m sure no one would complain about seeing St. Peter’s Basilica twice in five years. Again, if the exhibit is unique enough, I think the influx of new visitors will override the lack of returners.</p><h4 name="466c" id="466c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">So…</strong></h4><p name="50db" id="50db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4 graf--trailing">I’m amazed at how much user experience thinking came out of an afternoon and a random assignment. Thanks, Jon Bell.</p></div></div></section>
