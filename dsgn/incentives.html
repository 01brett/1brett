I would part the waters of corporate bureaucracy like the Red Sea. I point the path to good design like some Design Moses.</p><p name="5963" id="5963" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then I worked as the only designer at a 6-year-old startup.</p><p name="136f" id="136f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The pungent aroma of Designer Privilege clung to me in dense clouds. I considered making something awesome and nothing else. Beautiful! Usable! Clean! Consistent! I was single-minded in my pursuit, unwavering in my conviction. I probably said “this is important for the customer’s experience; we need to do this” once a day.</p><p name="6b19" id="6b19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And when tickets were sized by developers, estimates were gigantic. Design got reduced. My work got reduced. I couldn’t believe it! I assumed everyone’s desire to make something awesome would override any other concerns. Once they <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">see</strong> it, it’ll be an easy decision.</p><p name="4e19" id="4e19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My strategy was to push back against the reduction. “The customer’s experience will suffer,” I said. Yet, if the feature wasn’t launched by a certain date, we’d lose those very customers. The experience was secondary to the deadline. My designs vs deadlines. We always had deadlines.</p><p name="4cc6" id="4cc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I felt stuck until I remembered what we tried to do at my last job — a Pattern Library for our apps in Sketch. It was only for the designers and a bit unwieldy, but the idea had good bones. Unnecessary redesign and development time would shrink and velocity would skyrocket. Profits would soar. I’d be a hero. I’d lead the company into the Promised Land. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Spoiler: Moses never made it into the Promised Land. But Israel did get there in the end.</em></p><h3 name="7802" id="7802" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Designers Shouldn’t Code</h3><p name="2384" id="2384" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I didn’t jump into code at first. The developers would probably want to make their own front-end code repo. A developer friend said he manages the front-end code stuff. A designer trying to help write code wouldn’t be much help.</p><p name="6fc0" id="6fc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, I sent off a PNG.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="c7cd" id="c7cd" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 597px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 59.699999999999996%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*sdy_PUFNsGpmUi4oo3Ju_A.png" data-width="3756" data-height="2242" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*sdy_PUFNsGpmUi4oo3Ju_A.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">PNG Pattern Library</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="58f5" id="58f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I attached this PNG to every ticket. I hoped the developers would manage the code and I’d provide the creative direction. But, I started evolving the Pattern Library. Successive tickets got different PNGs. “Oh, but the developers could update their central front-end repo with the latest PNG stuff,” I thought. That didn’t happen. I almost drowned in PNGs trying to keep everything straight.</p><h3 name="0d3f" id="0d3f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Designers Should Code A Little</h3><p name="7916" id="7916" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Complex PNGs were too much. I would see developers inspecting the PNGs like ancient maritime maps. Everyone was struggling to grok the Pattern Library Atlas. And since no front-end repo was made, I solved the problem by starting one. I assumed starting a repo was hard (or at least tedious). The developers were busy developing. They simply didn’t have the time to spin up a new repo. I would fix the issue with this simple act.</p><p name="6b57" id="6b57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I’ve learned lots more about Git since then.</em>🤓</p><p name="3605" id="3605" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That didn’t work either.</p><h3 name="eb8c" id="eb8c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Designers Should Code Everything</h3><p name="96bb" id="96bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I was 0–2 in Pattern Libraries. I needed to go deep in research and code. I thought I failed because I hadn’t done enough research. I would impress the team with a robust plan.</p><p name="7917" id="7917" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I found great writing and thinking in Atomic Design, BEM, Tachyons, and some pieces by <a href="http://philipwalton.com/articles/css-architecture/" data-href="http://philipwalton.com/articles/css-architecture/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Philip Walton</a> and <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/" data-href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nicolas Gallagher</a>. The benefits espoused by these developers fit my goals perfectly: speed of development and ease of maintenance. Pattern Libraries would be a proverbial box of Legos for building interfaces. And, changing components in the Pattern Library would be a snap since the front-end code is centralized and visible. The dream of an evolving interface would realize — out of the box, too.</p><p name="466f" id="466f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But, I needed extra help. Our company is a full-stack developer company. Front-end is no single person’s “job.” One developer was passionate about front-end. He was pumped to join my cause!</p><p name="da8e" id="da8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I pitched the Developer Lead and Chief Product Officer on letting me grab him for one month. I could use him to lay a strong foundation for the Pattern Library. The company would save money in the long term with a small short term investment of one developer not doing other stuff. Framing the work in business terms helped. A lot.</p><p name="9ca0" id="9ca0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I can see little flashes of myself understanding incentives here. Funny how we can sort of half learn things before the big Aha! moment.</em></p><p name="0164" id="0164" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I kicked off the project by presenting my research to the developers. I got very passive approval. I made a (S)CSS <a href="https://github.com/brettflora/codeguide" data-href="https://github.com/brettflora/codeguide" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codeguide</a> to help with writing CSS, <a href="https://github.com/brettflora/architecture" data-href="https://github.com/brettflora/architecture" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Front-end Architecture</a> to help with overall vision. These documents would serve as a reference and training ground for developers.</p><h3 name="a7a6" id="a7a6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Live Code Legos</h3></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="5226" id="5226" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--h3"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1000px; max-height: 560px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.00000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*wJB1xrhhSusOu3YZ83fDmw.png" data-width="2370" data-height="1328" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*wJB1xrhhSusOu3YZ83fDmw.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Live Code FTW</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="304e" id="304e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A month’s worth of hard <a href="http://navigatingcancer.com/styleguide" data-href="http://navigatingcancer.com/styleguide" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">work</a> was finally out in the world. The Pattern Library was more robust than ever before. We set ambitious plans and hit most of them!</p><p name="d4f8" id="d4f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet, the developers reacted with “meh.”</p><p name="bc4e" id="bc4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was gutted. A couple developers used the Pattern Library over the next month, mainly as a place to dump CSS. Most developers ignored and forgot about it.</p><p name="6a4b" id="6a4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I discovered not everyone interpreted “Pattern Library” in the same way. Some assumed the Pattern Library would mean they’d never have to write CSS ever again. When v3 launched, and they still had to write CSS for new components, their motivation to use the Pattern Library was nil.</p><h3 name="9968" id="9968" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Lesson Learned</h3><p name="c1b7" id="c1b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">My strategy failed because I did nothing to improve the lives of developers in terms of their interests. I was looking too far downstream to the improvements for the customer. I overlooked the gatekeepers between the now reality and the goal reality.</p><p name="85bc" id="85bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I see parallels in government policy, in topics like climate change. Why does a policy fall flat? I think it comes from one side ignoring what the other side is interested in. Shutting down coal mining will help the planet, but those workers will lose their jobs. I see lots of similarities between Senators and designers.</p><p name="c5ec" id="c5ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Changing minds and culture takes time. When I first started at the startup, “front-end developer” was a dirty word. My Pattern Library attempts have pushed front-end into the foreground. This is the long game approach. Even though my attempts failed, I kept trying. And front-end stayed in the foreground, it stayed so long others started paying attention. And now, though the company still hires full-stack, another front-end passionate developer has joined the team.</p><p name="b30a" id="b30a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With another comrade, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">we</em> are taking another attempt at a Pattern Library. I’m letting the two front-end savvy developers lead. From the beginning, we’re asking the other developers “how can this be useful to you?” My role is to encourage and support. I’m enjoying this approach much more.</p><blockquote name="b2a3" id="b2a3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">We solve our problems together or not at all.</blockquote><p name="d76e" id="d76e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing">(from a Jonathon Colman <a href="https://vimeo.com/142200130" data-href="https://vimeo.com/142200130" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">talk</a>)</p></div></div></section>
